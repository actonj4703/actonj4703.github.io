    <p>Hello my name is Joshua Acton I decided to make a webpage about Yugi-oh! cards. I am a student and going through a programming intro class. I love food card games and video games! I would also like feedback on my website feel free to leave some on the contact page. As you can tell I also really like Yugi-oh! and that is why I wanted to share this passion of mine with this website.</p>
